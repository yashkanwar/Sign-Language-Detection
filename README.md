# Sign Language Detection

This project aims to detect and interpret sign language gestures using machine learning techniques. It provides a real-time solution for translating sign language into text or speech.

## Features

- Real-time sign language detection using a webcam.
- Translation of gestures into text or speech.
- User-friendly interface for interaction.

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run ui.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to start interacting with the application.

3. Use sign language for real time detection.

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras (for machine learning models)
- Streamlit (for web interface, if applicable)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
